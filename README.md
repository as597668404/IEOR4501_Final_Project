This is a project that analyzing Uber and Yellow Taxi rides in New York City area from 2009 to 2015 and their relationships with the weather. In this project, we created a Jupyter Notebook with Python codes that load the data and analyze different questions about YellowTaxi rides, Uber rides, and the weather. We also generated SQL files which include schema and necessary queries. To help the readers to gain a better understanding on how we accomplished it, we also include a text file that shows all the Python packages we utilized during the project. In addition, we also created a ".gitignore" file that helps to ignore files that should not be committed.
